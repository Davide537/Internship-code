# Internship-code

This github contains the code used in my internship: 

- File "training_FRNN.ipynb" and "training_LSTM.ipynb" contain the functions that define the training for the two models. The files also have an Example section that shows how the functions are used to create, train and unroll a NN.

- The Dataset folder contains the file "model_od_lake.ipynb" which was used to generate dataset. In the same folders, we also have pgns of the datasets created along with the corresponding numerical values save in jld2.

- Dense plots and LSTM plots contain the plots I placed in the report and some saved data used to generate them. They were generated by the "Make plots.ipynb" file
